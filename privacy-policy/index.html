    <h1>Privacy Policy for No Hangs</h1>
    <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: January 21, 2026</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        No Hangs ("we", "our", or "the app") is a hangboard training application for climbers. 
        We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in our app.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Collection and Storage</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>No Hangs does not collect, transmit, or share any personal data.</strong> All data created and used by the app is stored locally on your device only.
    </p>

    <h2>Information Stored Locally</h2>
    <p>The app stores the following information locally on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Training session data (exercises, reps, weights, dates)</li>
        <li>Exercise configurations and settings</li>
        <li>Personal best records</li>
        <li>App preferences and settings</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data remains on your device and is never transmitted to external servers or third parties.</p>

    <h2>Bluetooth Connectivity</h2>
    <p>
        The app uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to connect to compatible force measurement devices (such as Tindeq Progressor). 
        This connection is used solely for receiving measurement data from the device. No data is transmitted from the app to the device 
        or to any other party.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        No Hangs does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or data collection services.
    </p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>The app may request the following permissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Bluetooth:</strong> Required to connect to compatible force measurement devices</li>
        <li><strong>Location (Android):</strong> Required by Android OS for Bluetooth scanning (no location data is collected or used)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        Since all data is stored locally on your device, your data security depends on your device's security measures. 
        We recommend keeping your device secure with appropriate passwords or biometric locks.
    </p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Our app does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under the age of 13.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected with an updated "Effective Date" at the top of this policy.
    </p>
